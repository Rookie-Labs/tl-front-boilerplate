# Routes

Here you'll create a folder for each screen your app has.

This is specially useful in big projects and the building journey that will take you and your team there.

Each screen folder should be grown in a similar way that the layout one. 

Create folders for:

- Components shown in that screen.
- The store they read/write data from.
- Its styles (standalone file).
- Types related to the components in the screen (standalone file)
- Test script (standalone file).
